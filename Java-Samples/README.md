# Java Code Samples Repository

This repository showcases my Java programming skills, from beginner to project-level code. The code is organized into folders by difficulty:

- **Beginner**: Basic Java programs (e.g., Hello World, variables, loops)
- **Intermediate**: Object-oriented programming, collections, file I/O, etc.
- **Advanced**: Multithreading, networking, design patterns, etc.
- **Projects**: Complete Java projects demonstrating real-world applications

## How to Use
- Browse each folder to see Java code.
- Each file is self-contained and can be compiled/run individually.
